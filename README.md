# Pandas: School Data Analysis 

This notebook analyzes school data to determine the efficacy of private vs. public school in a comprised district. The Jupyter Notebook uses Pandas to filter, group, and calculate the data in various ways, including: 

* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)
* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
* Average reading score
* Average math score
* Total budget
* Total students
* Total number of unique schools

These analyses were conducted across:
* District
* School
* Test subject
* School budget 

From these analyses this notebook ultimately determines:
* Highest & lowest performing schools
* Implications drawn by scores compared to their school budgets
